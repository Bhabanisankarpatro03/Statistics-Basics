    "**2. Median**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* **Definition:** The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\r\n",
    "* **When to use:** The median is useful when the data is skewed or has outliers. It's less affected by extreme values than the mean. It's often used for skewed distributions like income or housing prices.\r\n",

By selecting individuals randomly, researchers aim to minimize bias and ensure that the sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Role of Random Sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representative Sample:**\n",
    "   * **Unbiased Selection:** Random sampling ensures that each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. This reduces the likelihood of systematic bias, where certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented.\n",
    "   * **Accurate Reflection:** A representative sample mirrors the population's characteristics, making it a reliable foundation for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Statistical Inference:**\n",
    "   * **Confidence Intervals:** Random sampling enables the calculation of confidence intervals, which provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.\n",
    "   * **Hypothesis Testing:** By analyzing the sample data, researchers can test hypotheses about the population and draw conclusions with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generalizability:**\n",
    "   * **Extending Findings:** If a sample is truly random and representative, the findings from the sample can be generalized to the larger population. This allows researchers to make broader claims about the population's behavior or characteristics.\n",

    "**Types of Random Sampling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple Random Sampling:** Each individual has an equal chance of being selected.\n",

    "**Importance of Sample Size:**\n",

    "* **Statistical Inference:** It is the basis for many statistical tests and confidence intervals.\r\n",
    "* **Quality Control:** It is used to monitor and control the quality of products.\r\n",
    "* **Natural Phenomena:** Many natural phenomena, such as height, weight, and IQ scores, follow a normal distribution.\r\n",
    "* **Financial Modeling:** It is used to model the behavior of stock prices and other financial variables.\r\n",

    "**Real-life Example of a Poisson Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Poisson process** is a stochastic process that models the occurrence of events over time or space, where the events occur randomly and independently. A common real-life example is the number of customers arriving at a store in a given time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions of a Poisson Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Independence:** The occurrence of an event in a particular time interval is independent of the occurrence of events in other intervals.\n",
    "2. **Stationarity:** The rate of occurrence of events remains constant over time.\n",
    "3. **Randomness:** Events occur randomly and unpredictably.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculating Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A store, on average, receives 10 customers per hour. What is the probability that the store receives exactly 15 customers in the next two hours?\n",

    "P(X = k) = (e^(-λt) * (λt)^k) / k!\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* P(X = k) is the probability of k events occurring in the given time interval.\n",
    "* λt is the average rate for the given time interval.\n",
    "* k is the number of events we're interested in (in this case, 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculate the probability:**\n",
    "P(X = 15) = (e^(-20) * (20)^15) / 15!\n",

    "Using a calculator or statistical software, we can calculate this probability.\n",

    "**Note:** Poisson processes are widely used in various fields such as telecommunications, finance, and operations research to model events like phone calls, stock price movements, and machine failures.\n"
